I hope this message finds you well. We’ve received a notification from Have I Been Pwned (HIBP), a trusted security service, indicating that the email addresses of 50 colleagues, including yours, have appeared in a large dataset of credentials exposed by malware. This dataset, known as "ALIEN TXTBASE," contains login details captured from various websites people have visited, likely due to malware on personal or shared devices.

What This Means

This doesn’t necessarily mean our company’s systems have been breached. Instead, it suggests that some of your credentials—potentially including work ones—may have been captured when entered into websites, which could range from personal accounts (e.g., Netflix) to work-related services. Without specific details yet, we can’t rule out that work passwords might be affected, especially if they’ve been reused across different sites.

Action Required

To keep our systems secure, please take the following steps as soon as possible:

Change Your Work Password: Log in to [insert system/portal name, e.g., company intranet or email] and update your password. Choose a strong, unique password—something you haven’t used elsewhere.
If you need help, our IT team is available at [IT contact info].
Avoid Password Reuse: If you’ve used your work password on personal accounts, update those too, as malware often targets credentials that can be tried across multiple services.
Stay Vigilant: Watch for unusual activity on your work accounts and report anything suspicious to IT immediately.
